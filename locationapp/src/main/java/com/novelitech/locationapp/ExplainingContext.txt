CONTEXT IN ANDROID

Context is Android's handle to the current environment of the app. It represents "Where am I,
and what can I do in the Android system?"

Every Context instance, not matter the type, is tied to:
- A lifecycle
- A scope (application, activity, service)
- A set of resources and permissions

Now below, I'll show the main types of CONTEXT

1 - Application Context: applicationContext
- Lives as long as the app process
- NOT tied to UI
- Safe to store as a singleton (if I try to use a context of Activity this one will never be
garbage collected. SO ALWAYS USE APPLICATION CONTEXT TO THIS)
- No memory leaks if used properly

Use it for: Databases, Repositories, SharedPreferences, WorkManager, Analytics, System services not
tied to UI

DO NOT use it for: Showing dialogs, Inflating views with themes, Starting UI flows

2 - Activity Context: this // inside Activity
- Lives as long as the Activity
- Knows about themes, window, UI
- Can leak memory if stored improperly

Use it for: UI inflation, Navigation, Dialogs, Toasts, Getting themed resources

DO NOT store long-term

3 - Service Context
- Similar to Application context
- Used for background operations
- No UI access

-- // -- // -- // -- // -- // -- // -- // -- // --

Context in Jetpack Compose
- LocalContext -> val context = LocalContext.current
- This is usually the Activity context

Use it for: Showing toast, Launching Intents, Accessing resources

DO NOT store this value (because of garbage collector as it's linked with an activity - most cases)
